# wordbomb-exp1
Public word bomb script for ROBLOX that supports humanlike autotyping and more! This is the first version of this script, so it will not be fully polished and it won't look nice but the functionality is there. Be aware that the script may cause little lag spikes on low-end devices.

This script will work as long as raw.githubusercontent.com/Artzified/WordBombDictionary/refs/heads/main/words.txt exists.

# This repository has been archived on the 1st of January, 2025. There won't be any upcoming changes to this script. This script will be replaced by it's more significant counterpart "wordbomb-exp2".
